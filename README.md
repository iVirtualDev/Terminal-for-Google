Please follow the original read me and branch files , iVirtualDev (a github account for iVirtual Networks,LLC 
run primarily by Z. Isaac Garza ) would simply like to state here before any other announcements Public or not 
for in house reasons and as member of this branch that dev stage and progress is not always easily documented to protect our VMWARE Desktops Files. I use this for in house Dev. Projects.
